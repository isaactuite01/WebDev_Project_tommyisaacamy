            <h5>Dolomites - 8.7/10</h5>
            <p>
                Last winter I visited Dolomites with my family for a week and had a wonderful time. 
                The resort had a great variety of slope difficulty and made it accessible for skiers of all ages and ability.
                The agency made it simple and quick to organise everything from accomodation, rental skis, slope passes, transportation and more.

            <h5>Sierra Nevada - 9.6/10</h5>
            <p>My friends and I travelled to Sierra Nevada for a girls holiday last November. 
                We had many beginners in our group and had no idea how to organise the trip. 
                Snow trails travel agency guided us to group lessons and renting equipment.#
                We highly recommend using them to plan your future endeavours.

            <h5>Whistler - 7.9/10</h5>
            <p>In October me and my Skiing team travelled to Canada to practice for our next competition. We had a great time and got in some good practice over the week. Snow Trails travel
                were great at helping us plan the trip however we did have slight issues with our accomodation. Overall it was good and would recommend.  </p>
